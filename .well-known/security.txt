# Our Response Timeline:
# - Initial response: 48 hours
# - Triage: 7 days
# - Critical fixes: 7-14 days
# - Public disclosure: 90 days (coordinated)

# Scope:
# - Core compiler: crates/lexer, crates/parser, crates/ast, crates/typechecker
# - Runtime: crates/runtime
# - Standard library: crates/stdlib (when implemented)
# - Build tools: justfile, flake.nix
# - Example code: examples/ (educational only, not production)

# Out of Scope:
# - Third-party dependencies (report to upstream)
# - Social engineering attacks
# - Physical attacks
# - Hypothetical vulnerabilities (without PoC)

# Bug Bounty: No formal program (community goodwill)
# Recognition: Security Hall of Fame in SECURITY.md + MAINTAINERS.md

# Security Features:
# - Memory safety: Rust ownership model
# - Type safety: Strong static typing
# - Affine types: Resource safety (opt-in)
# - Contract verification: Pre/post-conditions
# - Offline-first: No network dependencies
# - Reproducible builds: Nix flake

# Known Limitations (see SECURITY.md for details):
# - Parser: Potential stack overflow on deep nesting
# - Lexer: No input size limits
# - Comptime: May not terminate (Turing-complete)
